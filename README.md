## What Does Our App Do?

Our app will allow a user to input ingredients they have at home to find recipes they can make with those ingredients.

## Key Features

* Divides ingredients into separate categories
* Displays all recipes in database that match user-input ingredients
Provides detailed recipe information to include serving size and cook times
* If no matches are found, the app suggests recipes that only require 1 additional ingredient
