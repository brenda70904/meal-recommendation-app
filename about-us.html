      <h2>Brenda Jow</h2>
      <p>Meet Brenda Jow! Who said "Thanks to my dad who made up his last name so no one actually knows how to
        pronounce my last name. My last name is pronounced “Jo”" She is orginally from Taiwan and moved to the U.S when
        she was 14
        years old.</p>
      <p>Brenda graduated from the University of Washington, majoring in Early Childhood and Families Studies. She found
        her
        first passion - teaching, when volunteering at a Chinese school, and ever since she's been working in the
        education field for almost 9 years. Now she found her second passion - coding. Learning how to code is not just
        going to give her the opportunity to work in a different environment and challenge herself, but it also gives
        her
        the opportunity to build something that might benefit other people.</p>
      <p>Our team loves food, and we always have the same problem after a long day, we cant decide what to eat for
        dinner. So we came up with the idea that building an app that helps us decide what to make! I hope you like the
        idea and the app!</p>

      <h2>Jason Christopher</h2>
      <p>Jason Christopher lives in Oklahoma City with his wife and two sons. They have been stationed in OKC since 2013
        and will be there for the foreseeable future since his wife is on active duty orders with the Oklahoma Army
        National Guard.</p>
      <p>Jason was active duty Air Force for eight years before deciding to transition to the Air Force Reserves where
        he still does the same job as an Air Battle Manager on the E-3 AWACS…but now only part-time. He graduated from
        the University of Florida and is a huge Gators fan!</p>
      <p>Jason and his wife love cooking so deciding to help build this site was a no-brainer since he'll probably use
        it to help them discover new recipes and utilize the ingredients they already have. Jason has really enjoyed his
        software development journey so far and can't wait to see where it leads!</p>
